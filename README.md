5. Transparency and Compliance:
Disclose Affiliate Relationships: Clearly disclose your affiliate partnerships to your users to maintain transparency and build trust.
Comply with Regulations: Familiarize yourself with relevant regulations, such as FTC guidelines, to ensure compliance.
6. Development Considerations:
Deep Linking: Consider implementing deep linking to direct users from your app directly to specific product pages within the affiliate merchant's app.
